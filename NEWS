Note: There is no guarantee that version mismatched client and server will
be able to talk with each other. Network protocol breakages won't be listed
here.

v0.x.x (xxxx-xx-xx)
-------------------

- Attention! All the header and source files used for integrating Tracy with
  applications were moved to the public/ directory. This will break your
  integration!
  - To fix this, update the source and include directories lists to point to
    the new location.
  - Tracy include files directly referenced by the client were moved to
    tracy/ subdirectory, to facilitate setups which previously had Tracy
    checkout parent directory in the include paths list (i.e. when you
    included "tracy/Tracy.hpp").
  - Previously, if you have included the Tracy checkout directory in your
    project include directories list (i.e. you could include "Tracy.hpp"),
    this could result in third-party library conflicts, e.g. with ImGui.
    Such scenarios are no longer the case.
- Tracy macros now require to be terminated with a semicolon.
- The undocumented ___tracy_demangle() function API has been changed. Please
  refer to the source code for further instructions.
- Plots visualization has been improved.
  - Each plot now has its own color, which can also be defined by the user.
  - The area below the plot is now optionally filled with a color.
  - Plots can now also be configured to be staircase instead of smooth. This
    new setting is appropriate for many inputs where only discrete values
    make sense, e.g. the memory allocation plot.
  - The API for TracyPlotConfig() macro has been changed. Please refer to
    the manual to see how you can fix this.
- Some text labels in the user interface are now more easy to read.
- The profiler will now instruct the user in the UI on what can be done, if
  the send queue is slow to process (typically due to symbol resolution).
- If a client with an incompatible protocol is discovered, Tracy will now
  try to show which versions can be used to handle the connection.
- Messages list in zone info window can now show messages exclusive to the
  zone, filtering out the messages emitted from child zones.
- Added capture of vertical synchronization timings on Linux.
- The range of frame bar colors in the frames overview on top of the screen
  can be now controlled with the "Target FPS" entry box in the options menu.
  - The "Draw frame targets" option does not need to be selected.
  - Previously the hardcoded FPS target thresholds were: 30, 60, 144 FPS.
  - Currently the FPS target threshold is: half of target, target, twice the
    target.


v0.8.2 (2022-06-28)
-------------------

- Added support for debuginfod debug information services. Note that
  since this depends on proper system configuration, vendors providing
  the debug information, and network retrieval, it is disabled by
  default. To enable, compile the profiled application with the
  TRACY_DEBUGINFOD define and link with libdebuginfod.
- When Tracy server-side utilities are build with MSVC, the required
  libraries will be now automatically retrieved and built with vcpkg.
- Added microarchitecture data for: Bonnell, Airmont, Goldmont, Goldmont
  Plus, Tremont.
- Recognize additional CPUIDs of Zen 3, Alder Lake, Ice Lake
  microarchitectures.
- Assembly line width will be now extended, if needed. Previously the line
  width was calculated for the initial layout and changing amount of
  displayed data (especially listing the read/written registers) didn't
  affect this, which may have made some lines partially unreadable.
- Added ability to filter call stacks in memory tab by inactive allocations.
  Filtering by inactive allocations helps to pinpoint wasteful allocations
  in the program.
- Plot graph will no longer display min/max values interpolated for
  animation, but rather true values.
- The CPU topology tree structure was replaced by a CPU schematic showing
  the same thing in a more concise way.


v0.8.1 (2022-04-21)
-------------------

- Support for pre-0.7 traces has been dropped.
- Update utility can now scan for source files missing in the trace cache,
  if the '-c' parameter is given. Found files will be added to the cache.
- Added high-priority queue for fast queries to bypass slow symbol queries.
- Fixed Android documentation to show how to enable context switch tracing.
- Workaround MSVC 2015 stupidity which prevented compilation as C++11.
- Added support for showing branch cost data for CPUs that don't report
  branch retirement events (but do report branch misses).
- The right-click context menu available for jump arrows in the symbol view
  window will now additionally display jump context, i.e. jump sources and
  jump target source code fragments.
- Added freedesktop.org compliant desktop entry and MIME type definition.
- The call stack column in list of messages will now be only displayed when
  at least one message on the list has call stack data.
- File dialogs on Unix will be now native to the desktop environment you are
  using. Note that this relies on xdg-desktop-portal and dbus.


v0.8.0 (2022-03-28)
-------------------

- Support for Cygwin has been dropped. It was not working for a very long
  time and nobody had complained about it.

- Properly handle rare cases when sampling on Linux is momentary not able to
  resolve time stamps.
- Added Rocket Lake microarchitectural data.
- Updated CPU identifier lists.

  - You can not only see the assembly source file and line, but also the
    originating function.
  - If symbol view is restricted to a single inline function, all assembly
    instructions not in this context will be dimmed out.
  - Likewise, the navigation in assembly code will be limited just to the
    inline context, if a single function is selected.
- Kernel call stacks will be now properly captured and displayed in the
  profiler. Kernel functions are marked with the red color.
- The CPU hardware performance counters can be now sampled on Linux.
  - Three inferred statistics are displayed for lines in both source and
    assembly code in the symbol view window:
    - Instructions executed per cycle.
    - Branch miss rate.
    - Cache miss rate.
  - Instruction cost estimation method is no longer tied to software call
    stack sampling.
- The image name filter entry field is now providing a list of available
  images.
- Reentrant function calls may be now excluded from calculations in the
  statistics view.

  that was to be set.
- A warning is now displayed when sampling data is out-of-order.
- Average value for plots can be now viewed.
- Moved symbol resolution to a separate thread. Profiling will no longer be
  stuck when there is a large number of symbols to resolve. This not only
  improves user experience, but also prevents buildup of data (and memory
  consumption) on the client side.
- Android device name will be now reported.
- Added support for capturing fibers.
  - Fibers require additional processing, which has to be enabled by adding
    the TRACY_FIBERS define on the client side.
  - Client code requires additional instrumentation using the new macros
    TracyFiberEnter and TracyFiberLeave (or the corresponding C API
    variants).
  - Fibers are represented in traces as separate threads, and are
    distinguished by green color. Faux context switch regions are used to
    indicate when a fiber is being run by the worker thread.
- Continuous frame marks no longer need to be issued from a single thread.
- Context switch call stacks are now captured on Windows and Linux.
  - Hovering the context switch wait region will now display wait stack,
    which may provide additional insight into why the switch happened.
  - Wait stacks inspection can be performed in a new view.
    - Stacks can be limited to certain threads and to a selected time range.
    - Stacks are presented either as a sorted list, or as a bottom-up and
      top-down trees.
- Entry call stacks can be now also viewed as a bottom-up and top-down
  trees.
- Updated project build files to MSVC 2022.

-------------------

- Linux crash handler will now also catch SIGABRT.
- Fixed invalid name assignment to source files discovered client-side.
- Added ability to check if a zone is active (which may be used to avoid
  preparing zone text, etc., as it wouldn't be used anyway).
- Improved sorting behavior of internal vectors.
  - Some data will now be always properly displayed during live capture.
    This was not particularly visible before, as it mainly concerns edge
    cases.
  - Sorting is performed only as needed.
    - In case of plots the performance during live capture may be decreased,
      as these were sorted with at least 0.25 second intervals before. Now
      the sorting is performed every frame.
    - Some other data, which previously was not sorted, is sorted now.
    - In headless capture mode sorting will be only performed when the trace
      is saved to disk.

    defined, tracing will not begin until a connection to server is
    established.
  - Since data is not fully captured in this mode, the resulting trace will
    be less precise, until application state is appropriately reset. For
    example, locks need to be fully released, zone stacks need to be
    flushed. This is an automatic process.
  - All tracing macros are able to work in the on-demand mode.
- Improved compatibility with various system setups.
- Aside from using TRACY_NO_EXIT define you can also set the same-named
  environmental variable to 1 to get the same effect.
- Added ability to show/hide all threads and plots.
- Performance improvements.
- Improvements to memory data presentation.
  - Added memory allocation info window.
  - Selecting memory allocation on a plot will draw time range of the
    allocation.
  - Middle clicking on an memory allocation address (or on a button in
    memory allocation info window) will zoom the view to the allocation
    range.
- Find zone menu improvements:
  - Zones can be now also grouped by call stacks.
  - Zone groups can be now also sorted by time spend in each zone.
  - Zone groups list now displays group times.
  - Average and median zone times are now displayed on the histogram.
  - Selected zones will be highlighted on the timeline view.
- Added named versions of tracing macros that allow specifying scoped
  variable name.
- The main profiler window is now kept at the bottom of windows stack.
- The "profiler" utility will now use a custom embedded font.
- Microseconds are now displayed using correct symbol ('μ' instead of 'u').
- Unix builds of the "profiler" utility will now ask for a file name when
  saving a trace.
- Progress popup is now displayed when a trace file is loading.
- Zones that share source location with a zone that is hovered over are now
  highlighted.
- Added ability to zoom-in to a selection range made using middle mouse
  button.
  - Holding the ctrl key will switch to zoom-out mode.
- The "profiler" utility will use less resources when its window is
  out-of-focus or minimized.
- Added support for cross-DLL profiling.
- Items in options menu (locks, threads, etc.) are now described with number
  of events.
  - Source location of lock declaration is also provided.
- Created an extensive user manual for the profiler.
- Added ability to capture multiple frame sets.
  - Viewer will display multiple frame ranges at once.
  - Only one frame set can be active at once. The selected one is used for
    the frame navigation graph, frame navigation buttons and drawing frame
    separators.
  - The active frame set will be highlighted, and the rest will be dimmed
    out.
  - Frames can now also be discontinuous.
- Frames and zones too small to be displayed will be marked with a zig-zag
  pattern.
- General improvements to message list and message markers.
  - Hovering over message on a list will highlight its marker (previously it
    only worked the other way).
  - Left clicking on a message marker will focus the message list on the
    selected message.
  - Middle clicking on a message marker will center it on screen.
- Added trace information window.
  - This includes frame time statistics and histogram.
- Displayed memory sizes are now properly formatted.
- Added call stack tree for memory allocations.
  - You can display allocations list for each call stack tree entry.
- The source code of the profiled application may now be viewed in the
  profiler.
  - BIG FAT WARNING: The actual profiled program source code is not known to
    the profiler. It only checks if there is a file on your disk that
    matches the file name of the captured source location. Even if the file
    is displayed, it may be out of date.
  - CPU and GPU zones will have "Source" button, if source file can be
    opened.
  - Source files for call stack traces can be opened by right-clicking on
    the file name. Since in this case there is no button that can be hidden,
    a small animation will be played to notify user if the source cannot be
    opened.
- The main profiler view will now occupy the whole window. Previous behavior
  is still available for embedded use cases.
- Many button labels are now accompanied by icons.
- Fonts should now be less blurry.
- "Go to parent" button in zone info window won't be displayed if there is
  no parent to go to.
- Improvements to the compare traces menu.
  - There are now colored markers to make it easier to distinguish "this" and
    "external" traces.
  - The amount of saved time is now displayed (a difference between total
    run times of both traces).
- Tracy will now collect host information, like CPU name, amount of system
  memory, etc.
- Windows builds of the "profiler" utility will perform a check of supported
  CPU instruction set and match it against the one required by the binary
  (by default AVX2 is used). If the program cannot be executed on the
  processor, a message dialog with workaround instructions will be
  displayed.
- Tracy can intercept crashes and finish sending data from a dying process.
  - Currently this is only implemented on Windows, Linux and Android.
- Call stack window may now display addresses of the frames, instead of
  source file locations.
- Memory events will now properly register their thread.
- Profiler settings are now stored in a persistent location.
  - On Windows settings are stored in %APPDATA%/tracy.
  - On other platforms settings are stored in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tracy or
    $HOME/.config/tracy, if the variable is not set.
  - The main profiler window position, size and maximized state are saved
    and restored.
  - The size and position of internal windows now doesn't depend on the
    runtime directory of the profiler executable.
- Added connection handshake.
  - Server won't be able to connect to client if there's a protocol version
    mismatch.
  - Client not in on-demand mode will refuse connections after the first
    connection was made and the initial event buffers were cleared.
- A single server will no longer try to connect to multiple clients.
- The capture utility will now display time span of the ongoing capture.


v0.3 (2018-07-03)
-----------------

- Breaking change: the format of trace files has changed.
  - Previous tracy version will crash when trying to open new traces.
  - Loading of traces saved by previous version is supported.
  - Tracy will no longer crash when trying to load traces saved by future
    versions. Instead, a dialog advising to update will be displayed.
  - Tracy will no longer crash in most cases when trying to open files that
    are not traces. Some crashes are still possible, due to support of old,
    header-less traces.
- Ability to track every memory allocation in profiled program.
  - Allocation event queuing must be done in order, which requires exclusive
    access to the serialized queue on the client side. This has no effect on
    the rest of events, which are stored in a concurrent queue, as before.
  - You can search for a memory address and see where it was allocated, for
    how long, etc. This lists all matching allocations since the program was
    started.
  - All active (non-freed) allocations may be listed. This shows the current
    memory state by default, but can go back to any point in time.
  - Graphical representation of process memory map may be displayed. New
    allocations/frees are displayed in a bright color and fade out with
    time. This feature also can look back in time.
  - Memory usage plot is automatically generated.
  - Basic allocation information is displayed in memory plot tooltips.
  - A summary of memory events within a zone (and its children) is now
    printed in zone info window.
- Support loading profile dumps with no memory allocation data (generated by
  v0.2).
- Added ability to display global statistics of a selected zone from the
  zone info window.
- Fixed regression with lock announce processing that appeared during
  worker/viewer split.
- Allow selecting/unselecting all locks for display.
- Performance improvements.
- Don't save unneeded lock information in trace file.
- Don't save thrash in message list data.
- Allow expanding view span up to one hour, instead of one minute.
- Added trace comparison window.
  - An external trace has to be loaded first.
  - Zone query in both traces (current and external).
  - Both results are overlaid on the same histogram.
  - Graphs can be adjusted as-if there was the same number of zones
    collected.
- Read time directly from a hardware register on ARM/ARM64, if possible.
  - User-space access to the timer needs to be enabled in the kernel, so
    tracy will perform run-time checks and fallback to the old method if the
    check fails.
- Prevent connections in a TIME-WAIT state from blocking new listen
  connections.
- Display y-range of plots.
- Added ability to unload traces loaded from files. To do so close the main
  profiler window. You will return to the connect/open selection dialog.
  Live captures cannot be terminated this way.
- Zones previously displayed in zone info window are remembered and you can
  go back to them. Closing the zone info window or switching between CPU and
  GPU zones will clear the memory.
- Improved message list window.
  - Messages are now displayed in columns.
  - Originating thread of each message is now included in the list.
  - Messages can be filtered by the originating thread.
- You can now navigate to next and previous frame.
- Zone statistics can be now displayed using only self times.
- Support for tracing GPU events using Vulkan.
- Timeline will now display "OpenGL context" or "Vulkan context" instead of
  "GPU context".
- Fixed regression causing invalid display of GPU context appearance time.
- Fixed regression causing invalid reporting of an active CPU in zone end
  events, if MSVC rdtscp optimization was not enabled.
- Ability to collect true call stacks.
  - Supported on Windows, Linux, Android.
  - The following events can collect call stacks:
    - Memory alloc/free.
    - Zone begin.
    - GPU zone begin.
  - Zone stack trace now also displays frames from a real call trace.
  - On Linux call stack frame name resolution requires a call to dladdr,
    which in turn requires linking with libdl.
- Allow manual entry of GPU time drift value.
- Unix build system no longer shares object files between different build
  units.
  - Fixes inability to build debug and release versions of a single utility
    without "make clean".
  - Fixes incompatibility between "standalone" and "capture" utilities due
    to different set of used feature flags.
- On Windows "standalone" utility now adapts to system DPI setting.
- Optional per-call zone naming.


v0.2 (2018-04-05)
-----------------

- Fixed broken TRACY_NO_EXIT behavior.
- Visual refresh (new color scheme).
- Added optional support for live in-depth zone analysis.
  - Ability to search for zones matching a query.
  - Histogram of zone time spans.
  - List occurrences of a zone, grouped by thread, or by user text.
  - Zone groups can be selected and highlighted on histogram graph.
  - Support for linear and logarithmic display of time and values.
  - Histogram bins can show zone counts or total execution time.
  - Listed zones can be narrowed down by data range selection on histogram.
- Separation of server data handling code from the visualisation.
- Implementation of a command line capture utility.
- Support libraries have been updated.
- Fixed an issue that prevented de-duplication of source location payloads.
- Fixed an issue that prevented the ability to disable threads in settings
  menu, if two threads had the same name.
- Performance optimizations.
- Visual clean up of the settings menu.
- Zone info windows improvements.
  - Visual improvements to zone info window child list.
  - Zone info windows now show zone thread.
  - Display zone stack trace.
- Hide pause/resume button if there's no data connection (i.e. trace was
  loaded from file).
- Source location statistics view has been added.
- Fixed crash when a saved trace was opened, but no trace capture session
  was performed before.
- Standalone server will now open trace files passed as an argument to the
  executable.
- Fix possible crash in SetThreadName, that could happen if TLS init was
  delayed until first use of thread local variable.
- Store full thread name if pthreads (with 15 character name limit) are
  used.
- Properly handle unaligned memory access (no performance impact).
- Fixed broken lock identifiers in try_lock().


v0.1 (2017-12-18)
-----------------

- Initial release.
